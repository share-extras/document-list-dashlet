Document List dashlet for Alfesco Share
=======================================

Author: Will Abson

This add-on project for Alfresco Share provides the ability to list the contents
of a specific folder on a dashboard.

Installation
------------

The dashlet has been developed to install on top of an existing Alfresco
3.3 installation.

An Ant build script is provided to build a JAR file containing the 
custom files, which can then be installed into the 'tomcat/shared/lib' folder 
of your Alfresco installation.

To build the JAR file, run the following command from the base project 
directory.

    ant clean dist-jar

The command should build a JAR file named media-preview.jar
in the 'dist' directory within your project.

To deploy the dashlet files into a local Tomcat instance for testing, you can 
use the hotcopy-tomcat-jar task. You will need to set the tomcat.home
property in Ant.

    ant -Dtomcat.home=C:/Alfresco/tomcat clean hotcopy-tomcat-jar
